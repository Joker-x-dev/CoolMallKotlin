## üìñ Project Introduction

This is an open-source e-commerce learning project built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, with core
functionalities basically completed. The project adopts Google's recommended application
architecture and best practices, referencing the architectural design
of [Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid), aiming to demonstrate how to use
modern Android development technologies to build a complete e-commerce application. The project
features a complete e-commerce business process, including user authentication, product display,
shopping cart, order payment and other core functions, suitable for developers to learn and
reference modern Android development technologies.

As a technology-loving individual developer, I have invested more than half a year of my spare time
into this project. Every feature implementation and code optimization is the result of my careful
crafting during leisure time. Although the progress may not be as fast as a dedicated team, and some
feature implementations are not yet perfect, I will continue to improve and refine them. If you are
interested in Android development, whether for learning or collaborative creation, you are welcome
to join.

> If this project helps you, please give it a Star ‚≠ê This is very important to me and gives me the
> motivation for long-term updates and maintenance!

### Demo Download

> üåü **Tip**: The customer service chat and feedback features are fully functional. I genuinely read every message you send and will respond to each one, so please don't call me a bot....

- **Release Version (Recommended 4MB)
  **: [Click to Download](https://www.pgyer.com/CoolMallKotlinProdRelease)
    - Stable version optimized for daily use and experience, with optimal performance and size.


- **Debug Version (Developer 19MB)**: [Click to Download](https://www.pgyer.com/CoolMallKotlinDebug)
    - **Note**: The Debug version has a `.debug` suffix in the package name, different from the
      Release version, and can be installed alongside it.
    - **Built-in Tools**: Integrated with debugging tools such as LeakCanary (memory leak detection)
      and Chucker (network request monitoring).
    - **Performance & Size**: Due to enabled debugging features and no code compression, this
      version has lower performance than the Release version and larger APK size.
    - **Quick Access**: Long press the desktop icon to quickly access `Leaks` (memory leaks) and
      `Open Chucker` (network monitoring). To ensure receiving real-time network request
      notifications from Chucker, it's recommended to enable app notification permissions.


- **Supported Systems**: Android 8.0 and above
- **Update Notes**: Preview versions will be updated from time to time and may not fully sync with
  the latest code changes

## üöÄ Development Plan

This is a project purely driven by personal passion. As a full-time developer, I can only maintain
it in my spare time after work. Every line of code embodies my dedication during evenings and
weekends. Despite limited time, I still hope to create a complete e-commerce learning case through
this project. It is more suitable as a learning reference rather than a commercial application, as
some aspects have not yet reached commercial-grade standards. My goal is to provide other developers
with a practical platform for learning modern Android development technologies.

Due to time and energy constraints, the project's update pace may not be very fast, but I will
persist in long-term investment, gradually improving each functional module step by step. If you are
interested in contributing, whether in code, design, or documentation, you will be very welcome!

  high-quality learning projects

## üéØ Current Development Focus

The core e-commerce business processes of the project have been fully completed and are running
stably, including major functional modules such as user authentication, product display, shopping
cart, and order payment. The current development focus has shifted from feature implementation to
quality improvement and ecosystem enhancement:

   editing and app settings
2. **User Experience Optimization**: Refine interactive animations, improve visual feedback, and
   enhance overall user experience
3. **Performance Deep Optimization**: Memory usage optimization, startup speed improvement, page
   rendering performance tuning

### üöÄ Medium to Long-term Planning

4. **Code Quality Improvement**: Refactor legacy code, improve maintainability, and complete unit
   test coverage
5. **Multi-platform Ecosystem Expansion**: Advance development plans for HarmonyOS and iOS versions
6. **Community Building**: Improve development documentation, establish contributor guidelines, and
   promote open source community development
